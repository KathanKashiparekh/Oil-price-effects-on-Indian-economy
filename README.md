# Oil-price-effects-on-Indian-economy
Part of a project where I analysed how fluctuations in oil price affected the GDP outputs of various sectors of the Indian economy. 

Analysed effects of oil price shocks on the following sectors: agriculture,manufacturing,construction and transportation.

Applied the following techniques to get a cleared picture of the scenario: KPSS Stationarity Test,Johansen Cointegration Test,Vector Autoregressive(VAR) and Vector Error Correction(VECM) models,Impulse Response Functions,Forecast Error Variance Decomposition and  Granger Causality.

The results can be seen in the attached PDF file.
